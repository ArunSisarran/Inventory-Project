# Inventory-Project
An inventory program I made to help keep inventory organized at the MTA. The CSV file the data is saved to can be opened in Excel for help in making spreadsheets and reports.
**Note: Actual MTA inventory replaced with sample data in the Inventory.csv file.**
## Program functionality includes:
* Adding items
* Removing items
* Updating items
* Search by ID number
* Search by Category
* Saving to CSV file for spreadsheets
* Loading data from a CSV file
* Listing all items in the current Inventory System
